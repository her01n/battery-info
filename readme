## Requirements

- guile 3.0
- guile-lib 0.2.5
  from http://download.savannah.nongnu.org/releases/guile-lib/
- g-golf 0.8
  from git://git.savannah.gnu.org/g-golf.git
- gobject-introspection
- gtk 4
- libadwaita 1.3

## Description

This is a guile program using g-golf library to access Gio, Gtk and Adw libraries.
Information is collected using UPower DBus interface
(https://upower.freedesktop.org/docs/Device.html),
with the *gdbus* client from *Gio* library.
User interface is displayed using *Adw* and *Gtk* libraries.

I would like to display number of cells, or nominal voltage to battery information.
This is not provided by UPower interface.
It may be guessed by the technology, voltage and state values.

## libadwaita 1.4

The application may possibly benefit from using adw ToolbarView widget.
The information may be displayed in AdwActionRow's with "property" class.
These features become available in version 1.4 of libadwaita.
I would wait until this version is released.
  
## TODO
  
- more batteries
  - [x] branch to test more batteries
  - [x] bigger window
  - [x] display more batteries
  - [x] vertical scrolling,
        make sure the scroll bar is always visible if there is more content
  - [x] a way to dump all upower devices
        a button, that would allow to select a file to save all info
  - [x] refactor test-ui to use application-run
  - [x] flatpak build the branch
  - [x] push into beta branch,
        branch feature/more-batteries in battery-info and flathub
  - [x] build and publish test version
  - [x] ask lemonzest to test
  - [x] add lemonzest's upower.xml to repository
  - [x] fix booleans in upower.xml output
  - [x] add taran's upower.xml to repository
  - [x] show the dump button even when no battery is present
  - [x] hide export dump button behind compile-time switch
  - [x] merge to main
  - [x] update authors
  - [ ] release 0.2

- control with keyboard
  - [ ] ctrl+w, ctrl+q to close the window
  - [ ] allow selection over multiple lines
  - [ ] ctrl+a to select all, would this work?
  - [ ] enter to copy all info - make copy button the default button
      or some other keyboard shortcut
  - [ ] release 0.3

- do i need to specify the prefix in source for translations?
- post to /r/linux? and hacker news and lemmy
- gnome software still displays desktop only,
  the app should work on almost anything
- why does user have application data?
  we should not need to store any data
- refactor tests to user srfi-64 instead of hdt

- g-irepository-get-infos should work
- object info from g-irepository-get-info should have nice string representation
- g-golf browser?

- guile should print backtrace,
  in case the exception is thrown from a thread.
