## Requirements

- guile 3.0
- guile-lib 0.2.5
  from http://download.savannah.nongnu.org/releases/guile-lib/
- g-golf 0.8
  from git://git.savannah.gnu.org/g-golf.git
- gtk 4
- libadwaita 1.3

## Description

This is a guile program using g-golf library to access Gio, Gtk and Adw libraries.
Information is collected using UPower DBus interface
(https://upower.freedesktop.org/docs/Device.html),
with the *gdbus* client from *Gio* library.
User interface is displayed using *Adw* and *Gtk* libraries.

I would like to display number of cells, or nominal voltage to battery information.
This is not provided by UPower interface.
It may be guessed by the technology, voltage and state values.

## libadwaita 1.4

The application may possibly benefit from using adw ToolbarView widget.
The information may be displayed in AdwActionRow's with "property" class.
These features become available in version 1.4 of libadwaita.
I would wait until this version is released.
  
## TODO
  
- do i need to specify the prefix in source for translations?
- nicer make:
  - make should build gettext files and pre-compile scheme files
  - make test should test the application
  - make install should only install the files
- post to /r/linux? and hacker news and lemmy
- software still displays desktop only

- g-irepository-get-infos should work
- object info from g-irepository-get-info should have nice string representation
- g-golf browser?

- guile should print backtrace,
  in case the exception is thrown from a thread.
