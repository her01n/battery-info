## Requirements

- guile 3.0
- guile-lib 0.2.5
  from http://download.savannah.nongnu.org/releases/guile-lib/
- g-golf 0.8
  from git://git.savannah.gnu.org/g-golf.git
- gtk 4
- libadwaita 1.3

## Description

This is a guile program using g-golf library to access Gio, Gtk and Adw libraries.
Information is collected using UPower DBus interface
(https://upower.freedesktop.org/docs/Device.html),
with the *gdbus* client from *Gio* library.
User interface is displayed using *Adw* and *Gtk* libraries.

I would like to display number of cells, or nominal voltage to battery information.
This is not provided by UPower interface.
It may be guessed by the technology, voltage and state values.

## libadwaita 1.4

The application may possibly benefit from using adw ToolbarView widget.
The information may be displayed in AdwActionRow's with "property" class.
These features become available in version 1.4 of libadwaita.
I would wait until this version is released.
  
## TODO
  
- more batteries
  - [x] branch to test more batteries
  - [x] bigger window
  - [x] display more batteries
  - [x] vertical scrolling,
        make sure the scroll bar is always visible if there is more content
  - [ ] push into beta branch,
        branch feature/more-batteries in battery-info
        branch beta in flathub
  - [ ] build and publish beta version
  - [ ] ask lemonzest to test

- keyboard shortcuts
  - [ ] ctrl+w, ctrl+q to close the window
  - [ ] ctrl+a to select all, would this work?
  - [ ] ctrl+c to copy all the info if nothing is selected?
        or ctrl+shift+c, or just enter?
- do i need to specify the prefix in source for translations?
- nicer make:
  - make should build gettext files and pre-compile scheme files
  - make test should test the application
  - make install should only install the files
- post to /r/linux? and hacker news and lemmy
- gnome software still displays desktop only,
  the app should work on almost anything
- why does user have application data?
  we should not need to store any data

- g-irepository-get-infos should work
- object info from g-irepository-get-info should have nice string representation
- g-golf browser?

- guile should print backtrace,
  in case the exception is thrown from a thread.
