## Requirements

- guile 3.0
- guile-lib 0.2.5
  from http://download.savannah.nongnu.org/releases/guile-lib/
- g-golf 0.8
  from git://git.savannah.gnu.org/g-golf.git
- gobject-introspection
- gtk 4
- libadwaita 1.3

## Description

This is a guile program using g-golf library to access Gio, Gtk and Adw libraries.
Information is collected using UPower DBus interface
(https://upower.freedesktop.org/docs/Device.html),
with the *gdbus* client from *Gio* library.
User interface is displayed using *Adw* and *Gtk* libraries.

I would like to display number of cells, or nominal voltage to battery information.
This is not provided by UPower interface.
It may be guessed by the technology, voltage and state values.

## libadwaita 1.4

The application may possibly benefit from using adw ToolbarView widget.
The information may be displayed in AdwActionRow's with "property" class.
These features become available in version 1.4 of libadwaita.
I would wait until this version is released.
  
## TODO
  
- control with keyboard
  - [x] ctrl+w to close the window
  - [x] allow selection over multiple lines
  - [ ] ctrl+a to select all, would this work?
  - [ ] enter to copy all info - make copy button the default button
      or some other keyboard shortcut
  - [ ] release 0.3

- can i tell the main and add-on battery from the object path?
- do i need to specify the prefix in source for translations?
- gnome software still displays desktop only,
  the app should work on almost anything
- why does user have application data?
  we should not need to store any data
- refactor tests to user srfi-64 instead of hdt

- g-irepository-get-infos should work
- object info from g-irepository-get-info should have nice string representation
- g-golf browser?

- guile should print backtrace,
  in case the exception is thrown from a thread.
